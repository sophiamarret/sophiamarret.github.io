    <p>Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">.</a> The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">.</a> It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">.</a> Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">.</a> Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">,</a> just an unnecessary name of something<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">.</a> A question is a question<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">,</a> anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">.</a> Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">,</a> I always found it positively revolting<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">,</a> and now very few do use it<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">.</a> Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">,</a> they are unnecessary<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">,</a> they are ugly<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">,</a> they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">,</a> if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question<a href="./apostrophe.html" class="punctuation">.</a></p>
