    <p>The same thing is true of a quotation<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">,</a> and so we do not have to go any farther into that<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> There are besides dashes and dots<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">,</a> and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> They might if one felt that way about them. One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> Well feel as you like about that<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">,</a> I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> One does do without it<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">,</a> I do<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">,</a> I mostly always do<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">,</a> but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">,</a> there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">,</a> perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in<a href="./period.html" class="punctuation">.</a> </p>
