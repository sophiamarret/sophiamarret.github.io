    <p class="header">welcome to my wonder cabinet!</p>
    <p class="text">My item is a toy hello kitty flip phone that I've had since I was around four years old. My babysitter at the time gifted it to me when I was living in Hong Kong. Even though it's been about sixteen years since I got it, the phone is still in my room today. This was probably one of the first hello kitty toys/items I ever had, the start of an obsession that I seemingly never grew out of.</p>
